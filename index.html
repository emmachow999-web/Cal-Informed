      <h1>Your <em>Digital Footprint</em> — What Is It &amp; Why Does It Matter?</h1>
      <p>Every time you go online, you leave a trail of data behind. Understanding what that trail looks like — and who's reading it — is the first step to taking control.</p>

            <p class="prose">Data privacy is your ability to control what personal information about you is collected, how it's used, who it's shared with, and how long it's kept. It's not just about secrets — it's about power. When companies have your data, they have power over your experience, your decisions, and even your identity online.</p>
            <p class="prose">Think of it like your bedroom. You decide who gets to walk in, look around, and take things. Data privacy is the same concept — but for your personal information on the internet.</p>

            <p class="prose">Young people spend more time online than almost any other group — and companies know it. The California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act recognizes that children need <strong>extra protections</strong> because they're still developing the ability to evaluate risks and make fully informed decisions.</p>
            <p class="prose">Platforms that are "likely to be accessed by children" — including social media, gaming sites, and streaming services — are required to apply high-privacy settings by default and avoid manipulative design features like infinite scroll, autoplay, and reward loops that are built to keep you hooked.</p>
            <div class="callout"><strong>The Law Says</strong>California defines a "child" as anyone under 18. Platforms cannot profile minors or use their data for targeted advertising without explicit protections in place.</div>

            <div class="callout navy"><strong>Manipulative Design Features to Watch For</strong>Infinite scroll that never ends. Autoplay that plays the next video before you decide. Notification badges designed to create anxiety. Streaks and rewards that make you feel like you have to log in. These aren't accidents — they're intentional design choices to maximize your time on the platform and therefore, your data.</div>

      <h1>California <em>Privacy Laws</em> — What They Mean for You</h1>
      <p>California is the most privacy-protective state in the US. Here's a plain-English breakdown of the laws that give you real power over your data.</p>

            <p class="section-label">Why California?</p>
            <h2 class="section-title">California Leads the Nation on Privacy</h2>
            <p class="prose">The California Constitution explicitly guarantees a <strong>fundamental right to privacy</strong>. That's not a law — it's in the state's founding document. California has built on that foundation with some of the most comprehensive consumer privacy laws anywhere in the United States, and many of them specifically protect you as a young person.</p>
            <p class="prose">Because California is so large and influential, many of these protections have ripple effects nationwide — companies often apply California rules to all their users because it's easier than building separate systems.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <div class="callout"><strong>California Constitution, Article I, Section 1</strong>"All people are by nature free and independent and have inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and defending life and liberty… and <strong>pursuing and obtaining safety, happiness, and privacy</strong>."</div>
            <div class="callout navy"><strong>What This Means for You</strong>You have legally enforceable privacy rights. Companies that collect your data in California must follow specific rules — and you can take action if they don't.</div>

        <div class="law-block navy"><div class="law-tag">CPRA · 2023</div><h3>California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA)</h3><p>The CPRA expanded the CCPA significantly.

        <div class="law-block navy"><div class="law-tag">CalECPA</div><h3>California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (CalECPA)</h3><p>Protects your digital communications from government access.

        <ul class="steps-list">
          <li><div class="step-num">1</div><div class="step-content"><h4>Enable Global Privacy Control (GPC) in Your Browser</h4><p>GPC is a browser signal that automatically tells every website you visit "don't sell or share my data." It's legally recognized under California law. Use Brave browser (built-in), or install the Privacy Badger or DuckDuckGo extension on Firefox or Chrome. One setup, permanent protection.</p></div></li>
          <li><div class="step-num">2</div><div class="step-content"><h4>Review App Permissions on Your Phone</h4><p>Go to Settings → Privacy (iPhone) or Settings → Apps (Android) and look at which apps have access to your location, microphone, camera, and contacts. Revoke anything you don't recognize or didn't actively approve. Most apps don't need your location "always on."</p></div></li>
          <li><div class="step-num">3</div><div class="step-content"><h4>Use a Strong, Unique Password + a Password Manager</h4><p>Reusing passwords is one of the most dangerous habits online. If one site gets breached, attackers try the same password everywhere. Use a free password manager like Bitwarden to generate and store unique passwords for every site.</p></div></li>
          <li><div class="step-num">4</div><div class="step-content"><h4>Turn On Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</h4><p>2FA adds a second step to logins — usually a code sent to your phone. Even if someone has your password, they can't get in without that code. Enable it on your email, social media, and any accounts with personal info.</p></div></li>
          <li><div class="step-num">5</div><div class="step-content"><h4>Check HaveIBeenPwned.com</h4><p>This free tool tells you if your email address has been found in a known data breach. If you've been breached, change that password immediately on every site where you used it.</p></div></li>

        <h2 class="section-title">Key Terms Defined</h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">Privacy law comes with a lot of jargon. Here's what the most important terms actually mean.</p>
        <div class="glossary">
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">CCPA</div><div class="glossary-def">California Consumer Privacy Act. A 2020 law giving California residents rights over their personal data, including the right to know, delete, and opt out of data sales.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">CPRA</div><div class="glossary-def">California Privacy Rights Act. A 2023 expansion of the CCPA that added new rights (correct, limit use) and created a dedicated enforcement agency (CPPA).</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Personal Information (PI)</div><div class="glossary-def">Any data that identifies, relates to, or could reasonably be linked to you. Includes name, email, location, browsing history, purchase history, and much more.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Sensitive Personal Information</div><div class="glossary-def">A special category including health data, precise geolocation, racial/ethnic origin, sexual orientation, financial account details, and biometrics. Comes with extra legal protections under CPRA.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Data Broker</div><div class="glossary-def">A company that collects personal information from many sources and sells it to other businesses or individuals — often without consumers' knowledge.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">GPC (Global Privacy Control)</div><div class="glossary-def">A browser signal that automatically tells websites "do not sell or share my personal data." Legally recognized as an opt-out under California law.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">DPIA</div><div class="glossary-def">Data Protection Impact Assessment. A formal process companies must complete to identify and reduce risks to children's privacy. Required under California's Age-Appropriate Design Code.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Cookie</div><div class="glossary-def">A small file stored in your browser that tracks information about you across sessions. Third-party cookies track you across different websites, not just the one you're visiting.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Browser Fingerprinting</div><div class="glossary-def">A tracking technique that identifies you based on unique characteristics of your browser and device — without using cookies.</div></div>

          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">Opt-Out vs. Opt-In</div><div class="glossary-def">Opt-out means data collection happens by default and you must actively stop it. Opt-in means you must actively agree before data is collected. Opt-in is stronger protection.</div></div>
          <div class="glossary-item"><div class="glossary-term">End-to-End Encryption</div><div class="glossary-def">A method of communication where only the sender and recipient can read the messages — not the platform, not the government, not hackers. Used by Signal and WhatsApp.</div></div>
