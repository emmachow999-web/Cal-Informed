            <h3>California's Updated Privacy Law Takes Effect</h3>
          </div>
          <p>As of January 1, 2026, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) has been updated, giving Californians more control over their personal data. This means companies must be more transparent about the data they collect and provide easier ways for users to opt-out of data sharing. The CPRA also established the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce these new regulations.</p>

            <h3>New Study Reveals Teens' Social Media Data at Risk</h3>
          </div>
          <p>A recent study by the Pew Research Center found that many teenagers are unaware of how their social media data is being used. The study showed that 54% of teens aged 13-17 have experienced online harassment, and 45% have had their personal data shared without consent. This highlights the need for better education on online safety and data protection for minors.</p>

          </div>
          <p>The US Department of Justice has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Google, alleging that the company's data collection practices are anti-competitive and harm consumers.

              <h4>The Future of Data Privacy in California</h4>
              <p>As California continues to lead the way in data privacy regulation, there is ongoing debate about the effectiveness of the CPRA and the role of the California Privacy Protection Agency. Some argue that the law does not go far enough to protect consumer data, while others believe it imposes too many burdens on businesses. As the law continues to evolve, it is likely that we will see further debates about the balance between data protection and economic growth.</p>
