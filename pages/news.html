              <p>The use of personal data for targeted advertising has become a highly debated topic, with some arguing that it is a necessary aspect of online commerce and others claiming that it is an invasion of privacy. As consumers become more aware of how their data is being used, there is a growing demand for greater transparency and control over personal information.
