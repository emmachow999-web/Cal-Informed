              <h4>The Impact of AI on Data Privacy</h4>
              <p>The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in data collection and analysis has raised concerns about data privacy. As AI becomes more prevalent, there is debate about the need for new regulations to protect consumer data and ensure transparency in AI decision-making.
